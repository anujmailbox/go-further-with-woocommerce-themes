# [Go Further With WooCommerce Themes][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]


WooCommerce provides a lot of power and flexibility for simple storefronts out of the box, but to build truly outstanding sites, we have to dig a little deeper. In this course, Tuts+ instructor Rachel McCollin will teach you how to enhance your WooCommerce site with features such as embedded video, mega menus and filter menus. These will create a polished and compelling sales experience for your visitors and let them connect most readily with the products they're interest in.

This repository includes a starting theme, which was developed in Rachel McCollin's earlier [Developing a WooCommerce Theme](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/developing-a-woocommerce-theme) course. Then as features are developed in the course, modifications are added to that theme.
